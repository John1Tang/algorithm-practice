 * @description: 430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List
 * @author: john

 *
 *
 * You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.
 *
 * Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.
 *
 *  
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
 * Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:
 *
 *
 *
 * After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
 * Output: [1,3,2]
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The input multilevel linked list is as follows:
 *
 *   1---2---NULL
 *   |
 *   3---NULL
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: head = []
 * Output: []
 *  
 *
 * How multilevel linked list is represented in test case:
 *
 * We use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above:
 *
 *  1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
 *          |
 *          7---8---9---10--NULL
 *              |
 *              11--12--NULL
 * The serialization of each level is as follows:
 *
 * [1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
 * [7,8,9,10,null]
 * [11,12,null]
 * To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:
 *
 * [1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
 * [null,null,7,8,9,10,null]
 * [null,11,12,null]
 * Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:
 *
 * [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
 *  
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.
 * 1 <= Node.val <= 105
 *
